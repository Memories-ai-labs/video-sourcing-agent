# Video Sourcing Agent

# Background

Currently, [Memories.ai](http://Memories.ai) supports indexing videos and searching from indexed videos. However, we cannot index all videos from all platforms everyday. We need a way to source videos in real-time when receiving queries from users on [Memories.ai](http://Memories.ai).The goal of this project is to source videos from the internet and return results with references to answer our users’ queries.

# Goal

1. Analyzes a user’s query and turns it to sub queries or sub tasks related to video sourcing.  
2. Search videos in real time over the internet and designated websites (twitter, youtube, instagram, tiktok, facebook)  
3. Analyze searched information to decide whether to search more or need to execute more tasks.  
4. Utilize [memories.ai](http://memories.ai) API to do video indexing or video chat if necessary. (text data are not enough to complete the task and needs to analyze the video/watch the video)  
5. Generate answers for user’s query and append references to those videos.  
6. Wrap above functionalities into a service/agent.

# Tech directions

1. Function calling (web search API, [memories.ai](http://memories.ai) API)  
2. Browse-use (browse-use agent) [https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
